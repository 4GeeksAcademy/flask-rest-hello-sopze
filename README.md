# SWAPI clone

## What's this?

A basic fully-working REST api based on the Starwars API (SWAPI), made as an assignment for **4Geeks Academy Full-Stack** Bootcamp

It includes:

>- Useful and informative index page
>- **User**, **EntityType**, **Entity** and **Bookmark** tables
>- **Login** feature using a very basic *token* system
>- Database defaults on **JSON** format
>- Easy-to-define custom Entity and EntityTypes
>- **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** and **DELETE** endpoints to manage the database
>- Internal testing tools to create randomized rows or delete a random one
>- Additional endpoints to **reset**, **print** or **wipe** the database *(use with caution)*

## Check the API live

>1. Open this repo in **Github Codespaces**
>2. Run **`pipenv run upgrade`** to setup the database
>3. Run **`pipenv run start`** to start the API server in port 3000
